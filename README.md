# TAX GPT Application Setup

This README provides instructions for setting up the TAX GPT application, a chatbot powered by GPT designed to assist with tax-related inquiries. The application is built with Next.js and Django, and is containerized using Docker for easy setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you do not have Docker, you can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

## Installation and Running the Application

1. **Start the application using Docker:**
    - Simply run the following command to build and start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
    - This command will set up both the Next.js frontend and Django backend services.
2. **Accessing the Application:**
    - Once the Docker containers are up and running, you can access the application at:
http://localhost:3002
